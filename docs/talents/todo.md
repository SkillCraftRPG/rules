- **Light as a Feather.** While wearing no armor or only light armor, when an enemy hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to prepare yourself to disengage. Until the end of your next turn, your movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity from that creature.
- **Many Pockets.** You are able to hide a small number of knick-knacks, tools, or even creatures in crevices, pockets, or elsewhere on your person. If you are wearing clothing or light armor, you can store items weighing 1 lb or less (such as daggers, mice, or potions) in your clothes. You have advantage on checks related to keeping such items hidden and when you use an object interaction to retrieve one, you can retrieve two instead. In addition, as an action, you can maneuver one of these items into an easy-to-access spot. When you take the Use an Object action to use this item, you can do so as a bonus action. You can only have one item set up in this way at a time.

You gain the following benefits. • You ignore half of the weight of the armor you’re wearing for the purposes of encumbrance. • When you are subjected to an effect which would corrode, rust, or otherwise damage your armor, you can use your reaction to prevent it from being affected. • When a creature scores a critical hit against you while you are wearing medium or heavy armor, you can use your reaction to cause it to become a normal hit against you.

- **Shield Master.** If you aren’t incapacitated, you can add your shield’s AC bonus to any Dexterity saving throw you make against a spell or other harmful effect that targets only you. In addition, if you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you can use your reaction to take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, interposing your shield between yourself and the source of the effect.

## Robustesse

- **Built to stand.** When you’re wearing heavy armor, you have advantage on contested checks and saving throws against effects which would knock you prone or push you. In addition, your speed is not reduced by wearing armor with a Strength requirement greater than your Strength score.
