# Diplomatie

ðŸš§Attribut : **Charisme**

ðŸš§Usages:

- An eveningâ€™s time, a few gold pieces for buying drinks and making friends, and a DC 10 Gather Information check get you a general idea of a cityâ€™s major news items, assuming there are no obvious reasons why the information would be withheld. The higher your check result, the better the information. If you want to find out about a specific rumor, or a specific item, or obtain a map, or do something else along those lines, the DC for the check is 15 to 25, or even higher.
- Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation
- Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation
- Convincing others to do as you wish, in good faith.
- Coordinating allies.
- Dealing with merchant contracts on the Road of Kings.
- Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip
- In negotiations, participants roll opposed Diplomacy checks, and the winner gains the advantage. Opposed checks also resolve situations when two advocates or diplomats plead opposite cases in a hearing before a third party.
- Persuasion - convincing others and inspiring their emotions
- Persuasion is the ability to talk or trick others into doing what you want. Nonplayercharacters start at one of five different attitudes: Hostile, Uncooperative, Neutral, Friendly, or Helpful. A successful Persuasion roll improves the NPCâ€™s attitude one step, or two with a raise. Failure, on the other hand, decreases the characterâ€™s attitude by a step, or two if a 1 is rolled on the Persuasion die (regardless of the Wild Die).
- Skill at buying and selling items and finding a good deal.
- Socialize - social interaction in various situations
- Some situations require good manners and elegance, refinement, gentleness, and grace. They make the difference between the prince and the pauper.
- Streetwise - navigating urban streets and gathering intel there
- Streetwise characters are able to gather information from the street, saloons, or other contacts through bribes, threats, or carousing. Finding written information in libraries and the like is covered by the Investigation skill. Streetwise is always modified by a characterâ€™s Charisma modifier.
- You can change the attitudes of others (nonplayer characters) with a successful Diplomacy check; see the Influencing NPC Attitudes sidebar, below, for basic DCs.
- You can use this skill to persuade others to agree with your arguments, to resolve differences, and to gather valuable information or rumors from people. This skill is also used to negotiate conflicts by using the proper etiquette and manners suitable to the problem.
- You influence others through negotiation and flattery, or find out information through friendly chats.
