- Swimming
- Swimming determines if a character floats or sinks in water, as well as how fast he can move within it. A character‚Äôs Pace is half his Swimming skill in inches per turn in normal water (round up). Choppy water counts as rough terrain and halves this rate. Characters may not ‚Äúrun‚Äù while swimming for extra movement. Should it become important, characters can hold their breath for 5 x their Vigor in seconds, or half that if they weren‚Äôt prepared.
- Swimming.
- This is the skill characters use to ascend walls, trees, or cliff-sides. No roll is usually needed to ascend ladders, ropes, or trees with lots of limbs unless the GM feels there‚Äôs a good reason (being chased, wounded, etc).
- Tip over a statue
- With a successful Climb check, you can advance up, down, or across a slope, a wall, or some other steep incline (or even a ceiling with handholds) at one-quarter your normal speed.
- You are skilled at scaling vertical surfaces, from smooth city walls to rocky cliffs.
- You know how to swim and can do so even in stormy water.
- You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.
