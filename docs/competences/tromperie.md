# Tromperie

ðŸš§Attribut : **Charisme**

ðŸš§Usages:

- A Bluff check is opposed by the targetâ€™s Sense Motive check.
- Bluff is an opposed skill check against your opponentâ€™s Sense Motive skill.
- Convincing others to do as you wish, by charm.
- Gambling is useful in many settings, fromthe saloons of the Old West to the barracks of most armies. Hereâ€™s a quick way to simulate about a half-hour of gambling without having to roll for every single toss of the dice or hand of cards.
- Hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone's suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.
- Persuasion - convincing others and inspiring their emotions
- Persuasion is the ability to talk or trick others into doing what you want. Nonplayercharacters start at one of five different attitudes: Hostile, Uncooperative, Neutral, Friendly, or Helpful. A successful Persuasion roll improves the NPCâ€™s attitude one step, or two with a raise. Failure, on the other hand, decreases the characterâ€™s attitude by a step, or two if a 1 is rolled on the Persuasion die (regardless of the Wild Die).
- Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard
- Subterfuge - deceiving others and noticing it
- You are skilled at changing your appearance.
- You can trick and mislead others using disguises, lies, and other forms of subterfuge. Deception often has a drawback if you get found out, and it's often best to be out of town by the time this happens.
- Your Disguise check result determines how good the disguise is, and it is opposed by othersâ€™ Spot check results. If you donâ€™t draw any attention to yourself, others do not get to make Spot checks. If you come to the attention of people who are suspicious (such as a guard who is watching commoners walking through a city gate), it can be assumed that such observers are taking 10 on their Spot checks.
