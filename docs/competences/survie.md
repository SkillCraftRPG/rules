- Survival allows a character to find food, water, or shelter in hostile environments. A character may only make one roll per day. A successful roll finds sustenance for one person, a raise on the roll finds food and water for five adults. Horses and other large beasts count as two adults. Children, camels or others with small appetites count as half. Those who benefit from the roll do not have to make Fatigue rolls for the day for food, water, or shelter.
- Tracking allows a character to follow the tracks of one or more individuals in any type of terrain. Each roll generally covers following the tracks for one mile, but the GM may adjust this dramatically for more specific or small scale searches. Apply the modifiers below to each roll.
- You also excel at following trails and tracks left by others.
- You are adept at living in the wilderness, foraging for food and building shelter, and with training you discover the secrets of tracking and hiding your trail.
- You are skilled at surviving in the wild and at navigating in the wilderness.
- You can keep yourself and others safe and fed in the wild.
