ðŸš§Usages:

- Guts reflects a heroâ€™s bravery. Characters are often called on to make Guts checks when they witness grisly scenes or encounter particularly horrific monsters. The GM should see the Fear table for the effects of failure.
- Maintaining concentration.
- Recovering from lost Resolve and Trauma.
- Resisting coercion or persuasion.
- Resisting shock in battle.
- You must make a Concentration check whenever you might potentially be distracted (by taking damage, by harsh weather, and so on) while engaged in some action that requires your full attention.
